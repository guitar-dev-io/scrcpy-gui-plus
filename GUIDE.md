## 🎮 Feature Guide

### ⌨️ HID Keyboard & Mouse (OTG Mode)
ScrcpyGUI v4 features advanced hardware simulation (HID) for a lag-free experience.
- **HID Keyboard**: Simulates a real USB keyboard. This is the **only way** to fix issues with Polish accents, special characters, and international layouts.
- **HID Mouse**: Provides a high-precision, native cursor feel. Eliminates the "double cursor" or lag found in standard mirroring.
- **Pure HID (No Mirror)**: Perfect for when you only want to use your PC as a "controller" for your phone (e.g., typing long messages or playing games while looking at the phone screen).

### 📹 Pro Camera Mode (Webcam)
Turn your phone into a professional, hardware-controlled webcam.
1. Change **Capture Source** to **Camera**.
2. **Scan Lenses**: Click the **Refresh Lenses** button. ScrcpyGUI will instantly scan your phone and populate a spacious dropdown with all physical camera lenses, native resolutions, and zoom capabilities.
3. **Select Camera**: Select your desired lens (e.g., Ultra-Wide, Front, or Main Back) from the list.
4. **Advanced Controls**:
   - **Camera Torch**: Toggle your device's physical flashlight on or off directly from the GUI.
   - **Camera Zoom**: Adjust the dynamic zoom level slider (1.0x to 5.0x) to frame your feed perfectly.
   - **Failsafe Resolution**: Standard high-megapixel phone lenses can crash scrcpy if launched at their native 4:3 photo resolution (e.g., `4080x3060`) due to hardware video encoder limits. ScrcpyGUI automatically maps your selected resolution and defaults to a safe 1080p standard size (`1920x1080`), ensuring a crash-free experience.
   - **FPS**: Set to **Auto** (recommended) to let your device run at its native capture frame rate, or select **30 FPS**.
5. **OBS Integration**: Open **OBS Studio**, add a "Window Capture" source, and select the ScrcpyGUI window. Use OBS's **Virtual Camera** to use your phone in Zoom, Teams, or Discord.

### 🖥️ Desktop Mode (Virtual Display)
Turn your Android device into a secondary workspace or virtual monitor.
1. Change **Capture Source** to **Desktop**.
2. **Flex Display**: Toggle ON **Flex Display**. Dragging and resizing the scrcpy client window borders on your computer will dynamically scale the resolution and aspect ratio of your phone's virtual display on the fly to fit your window perfectly with no black bars.
3. **Background Color**: Customize the window borders or letterbox border colors by typing in a hex value (e.g., `#2b2d42`) with a live preview swatch.
4. **Keep Active**: Enable **Keep Active** to simulate activity and prevent the virtual display from turning off or sleeping during mirroring sessions.

### 🖥 Graphics Renderer (Render API)
You can choose which graphics renderer scrcpy should request for video display.

- **Auto**: Recommended default. Lets scrcpy choose the best renderer.
- **Manual Selection**: Options like Direct3D, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Metal, or Software may appear.

Renderer choices are **capability-aware**:

- ScrcpyGUI reads what your installed scrcpy build advertises.
- ScrcpyGUI filters options by your host OS.
- Unsupported options are hidden automatically (e.g. Metal is only shown on macOS).

### 📂 File Transfers & APKs
- **Install Apps**: Just drag an `.apk` file from your PC and drop it anywhere into the ScrcpyGUI window.
- **Transfer Files**: Drag any file into the window to automatically push it to your device's `/sdcard/Download/` folder.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Device not found?**: Try a different USB port or cable. Ensure "USB Debugging" is still active.
- **Laggy video?**: Lower the **Bitrate** (8M-12M is usually perfect) or the **Resolution**.
- **ADB Error?**: If commands are failing, click the **Kill ADB** button in the sidebar. This resets the connection bridge without closing the app.
- **Binary Error?**: If the app says it cannot find scrcpy, use the **Downloader** in the top right corner.
