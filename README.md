ScrcpyGUI v4 is a modern, feature-rich GUI for [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy), completely rebuilt from the ground up using **Tauri v2**, **React 19**, and **Rust**. It transforms your Android device into a professional tool for gaming, development, and content creation.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **✨ Best Looking GUI**: A stunning, modern interface with smooth animations and a premium look and feel.
- **🎨 Custom Theme Engine**: 5 premium, hand-crafted themes including **Ultraviolet**, **Astro**, **Carbon**, **Emerald**, and **Bloodmoon** to match your workspace setup.
- **🔄 Automated Binary Updates**: Deep-integrated system that automatically checks if your local `scrcpy` binary is outdated compared to Genymobile's latest official release, prompting you with a beautiful one-click update modal.
- **🎮 Precision Input (OTG)**:
  - **HID Keyboard**: Native hardware simulation for international layouts and special characters.
  - **HID Mouse**: Zero-lag, high-precision cursor control for a "native desktop" feel.
- **🖥️ Graphics Renderer Selection**:
  - Choose a renderer backend such as Direct3D, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Metal, or Software (capability-aware, OS-filtered).
- **🌐 Seamless Connectivity**:
  - **Wireless Pairing**: Native UI for Android 11+ wireless pairings.
  - **Connection History**: Remember and reconnect to wireless devices with one click.
- **📹 Pro Camera Mode (Webcam)**:
  - **Refresh Lenses**: Click to automatically scan and list all physical camera sensors, resolutions, and zoom ranges.
  - **Torch & Zoom**: Toggle your device's flashlight or adjust zoom level (1.0x - 5.0x) natively.
  - **Failsafe Camera-Size**: Automatically maps resolutions and defaults to safe 1080p dimensions, preventing hardware encoder crashes on high-megapixel devices.
- **🖥️ Desktop Mode (Virtual Display)**:
  - **Flex Display**: Drag and resize your virtual desktop window dynamically on the fly!
  - **Background Colors**: Customize scrcpy's border and letterbox color with hex values and a live color swatch.
  - **Keep Active**: Periodic user activity simulator preventing device sleep without changing global settings.
- **📁 Fluid File Management**:
  - Drag & drop APK installation or file pushing directly to `/sdcard/Download/`.
- **🖼️ Premium UX**:
  - **Splash Screen**: Zero-flicker, themed startup experience.
  - **Smart Folder Picker**: Automatically falls back to local `scrcpy-bin` or application executable directories when browsing folders.
